# Dramatis Person√¶
### The Player Character
Each player should bring a single unique focal character to the story.  These are the most fleshed out characters, with the most mechanical details.

#### Name, Epithet, Adjectives
Players should select a name for the character, as well as an epithet, which can be a descriptive byname, professional title, or archetype that provides a quick impression of what others might expect from the character.
It's also encouraged to list a handful of adjectives that describe the character.  In standard play, these aren't mechanically relevant, but are intended to simply provide a prompt of quide to roleplaying interactions with the character.  As such, they can be physcially descriptive (e.g. tall, dark, handsome) or summarize personality traits (e.g. kind, suave, assertive), or indicate other attributes (agile, strong, clever).

#### Signature
Each player character has a so-called **signature move** that represents a special way that the character solves problems.  These should of course be distinct from other player character's signatures.  This is the go-to, core ability that sets them apart from other characters, described in a few words.  These aren't meant to exhaustively describe a character's abilities, but instead are the player's choice of the one most essential kind thing that the character does *in his current incarnation*.

| Character | Signature |
|:---:|:---:|
| Annie Oakley | Trick Shot |
| Sherlock Holmes | Brilliant Deduction |
| Mata Hari | Seduce |
| Tarzan | Dominate |
| Dr Caligari | Mesmerize |

#### Vulnerabilities (crises?) Inclinations
In good stories, characters rise and fall, gain and lose, and change over time.  Vulnerabilities are the ways that this happens, particular to a character.  
#### Rally
#### Destiny (a way to level up)
### Main Characters
### Additional Cast
represent conflicts
embody resources
support characters and antagonists
### Option: Principal

# Resources & Advantages (Assets?)
people places things ideas
the face describes them and indicated their durability.
the reverse indicates the kind of problem that 
if they have no durability, they're advantages.

Relationships between main characters and between them and the principal are a special kind of resource.
    What matters is the stability and reliability of the relationship.  Enemies can have a solid relationship, and when it's "troubled" they need to resolve the uncertainty in the same way that friends who've had a falling out.
