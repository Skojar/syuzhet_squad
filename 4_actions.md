 players can describe additional actions and add xp to the beat.  
 go around the table until a certain limit (or until they run out of steam
 doing a "yes and..." improv maybe
 the number of times this happens is added to the xp for the roll and all the xp is approtioned equally to all the players.
- **press your luck** 
 on a straight (not bought) success, can choose to roll again for additional (double?) effect on another straight success.  
 successes can be chained as long as the player wants and can successfully roll.
 when they either decide to quit or don't succeed, that's what they get.
### playing out a story beat
1. That **goal**'s **owner** depicts a situation related to that **goal**.
1. The **owner** then designates any other player whose token is either **staged** or **on-screen** to **take the lead**.
1. The designated player may choose to accept, or decline and choose a different player (including the **goals**'s owner) to **take the lead** in her place.  This second player must accept.

### Strain a Resource
1. Roll a number of dice equal to the number of open rings on the resource.
1. For each one or six result, claim a bonus stone.
1. For each result of one, fill an open ring.
1. If there are no more open rings, *put the resource in crisis*.

### Resolving Questions with Rolls
The core means of determining how a beat or question is resolved is the roll.  The active character will roll a number of `start` and `stop` dice, with other players influencing the number of dice and the interpretation of the result, as follows:
1. Start by determining the number of `start` dice to roll.
    * Is the character doing something she is good at?  If so, add one `start` die.
    * Is the character doing something that is her `thing`?  If so, add one `start` die.
    * Add one `start` die for each character who prepared for this moment.  See `Flashback` below.
    * If you haven't added any dice, add one.  You should always roll at least one `start` die.
1. Roll your `start` dice.  Record the highest result.  If multiple sixes are showing, bank a number of `points` equal to how many extras there are.
1. Determine the number of `stop` dice to roll.
    * Is the character taking a risk?  i.e. will failure, fictionally, be bad for the character?  If so, add one `stop` die.
    * Is the character doing something that is, for whatever reason, difficult for her in particular?  If so, add one `stop` die.
    * Add one `stop` die for each relevant complication active on the character.
    * If you haven't added any dice, add one.  You should always roll at least one `stop` die.
1.  Roll your `stop` dice.  Add the lowest result shown to the result from your `start` dice roll.
    * The default target is eight (8). If there are any obstacles in the way, add one to that target for each.
    * Other players may choose to `lend a hand` at this time to decrease the target.
    * If your `start` result plus your `stop` result meet or exceed the target, the action is successful. Describe how the beat goes as you had hoped.
    * If by elimiating any number of `stop` dice would lead to a success, and the player has remaining `vulnerabilities`, the player may choose to **buy a success**.
        * take a complication with a rating equal to the number of dice being eliminated.
        * Describe how the beat goes as you had hoped despite the costs.
    * If it is not possible to buy a success, or the player chooses not to, then you fail:
    
        | If you're addressing... | ...then a failure means |
        |:---:|:---:|
        | agon | a new obstacle |
        | obstacle | a new hurdle |
        | constraint | nothing  |
        | crisis | nothing  |

        
1. Regardless of the outcome, the player marks experience equal to the number of `stop` dice less the number of `start` dice.


# Actions


### Take Center Stage
### Lead by Proxy
### Lend a Hand
### Make an Entrance
i.e. jump in to save the day, taking the complication from a bought success onto yourself?
Can you transfer a complication to yourself?
Can you convert someone else's hurdle to a challenge?
### Dialogue
i.e. two characters working on a complication or hurdle.
Must be in the same *location*, e.g. present, staged, or away
### Monologues
i.e. a character working on her own complications, without anyone else present.
### Chorus
i.e. two or more minor characters interacting with each other.  Can change conditions for main characters, like make a timeskip of location change, or change context.
### Flashback
If you have a boon or resource you'd like to spend to help or hinder the character at center stage, describe how it impacts the current beat.  If it's a boon, turn it over and add it to the bottom of the plot. If it's a resource, `strain it`.  In either case, either a single `start` or `stop` die to the roll.

You can retroactively create a resource or advantage by spending a `banked point`.  Describe how you prepared for this moment and roll
### Exit Stage Left
i.e. mark yourself an unoccupied after already acting in a scene.
### Delay the Inevitable
i.e. skip the remaining beats on a challenge by moving it to the bottom of the plot.
### Antagonize 
i.e. create a personal challenge for another player's primary character

partial successes essentially move obstacle points to character.  What would the reverse equivalent be?  
~This is needed to allow for adversarial relationships~
WRONG! adding to another character's conditions is a subset of `dialogue`!

# Adversity
Goals, Obstacles, Complications and Hurdles
challenges, Restraints, Threats, etc.
## Elements of a Challenge
* Owner
* Rating
* Question Prompt
    "How did we get here?"
    "What does this mean to you?"
    "Why does it matter?"
    * stakes: what is there to win or lose?
    
## Types of Goals
These are prompts from which the core story will be developed.  They are the roots of the tree.

    * Dilemma:  a character needs to decide between two paths
    * Desire: a character wants something that may be difficult to acquire
    * Destination: a character wants to get somewhere
    * Discovery: a character must come to terms with new information
    * Mystery: a character seeks the answer to a question
    * Exigency: events demand action from the character
    * Confrontation: someone (a rival) or something (a crisis) challenges the character's status quo
    
    
## Obstacles
## Complications
angry, upset, shaken, depressed, disarmed, disconnected, confused, vulnerable, obsessed, injured, distracted, embarassed, conflicted, weakened, harrowed, distress ed, hobbled

In all good stories, characters experience highs and lows, and change over time.  **complications** are the ways that this happens in the game.  In practice, a **complication** can be anything bad that can happen to cause trouble for a character or frustrate his efforts to act as he normally would. A character card includes a list of **complications** of a set length.  Each **complication** representing a issue that the character can struggle during the game.  When a player creates a new protagonist, she should give him three (3) **complications**.

There are a few different ways to approach this aspect of her character. She could explore how the character deals with adversity with more straightforward **complications** like _injured_ or _befuddled_.  These  indicate that the he is normally in good health and clearheaded, respectively. Alternatively, she could indicate that the character is especially susceptible to some failing or vice particular to him, with  **complications** like _enraged_, _panicked_, or _solipsistic_.  For many characters, however, it makes sense to have **complications** that represent some special quality inherent in the character.  A character that is normally invulnerable to harm, for instance, might have a complication like _vulnerable_, and a character who relies on the  use of swords or guns extensively might have a complication like _disarmed_.  Remember, these aren't necessarily problems that the character regularly faces in some hypothetical everyday life, but are instead things that the character should face in a story where he is called upon to face extraordinary challenges and circumstances that are appropriate to him as a character (though they might be the former as well).  There's no reason why a protagonist's **complications** and **gimmick** can overlap, but the interpretation of that overlap should be something a player considers ahead of time.

In play, **complications** describe situations that hinder or complicate action, but don't necessarily prevent it.  As with **signatures move**s, the most important thing is to choose challenges that the player is enthusiastic to describe her character suffering, or problems she's like to see him deal with.  A new charcter starts with a *complexity* of three (3), meaning that he should be given three **complications**, but may gain more as he grows.

When a rule asks a player to **gain a complication** at a given rating, she should look select from the list a **complication** with no **empty rings** next to it, and add a number of **empty rings** equal to the rating.  If there are no **complications** on the list without **empty rings**, she cannot **gain a complication**.  An alternative may be prescirbed by the rule in question, but if not the defulat alternative is to **enter a crisis**.

**Crises** are a special story element that have a rating just like **complications**.  They get their own card, turned perpendicular to the direction the player is facing, to indicate what role they play.  That role fits the situations they are meant to represent:  those in which the character's actions are seriously limited, such as being tied up, unconscious, or trapped.  Together, **complications** and **crises** represent things in the story that are happening to a particular character rather than shared among all the characters.

## Types of Hurdles
trapped, crippled, unconscious, despondent, restrained, seperated

   |   | Shared | Personal |
   | ---: | :---: |:---:|
   | Requires action | Goal | Hurdle |
   | Hinders action | Obstacle | Complication |
    
   
   | Fabula Element | Goal | Obstacle | Hurdle | Complication |
   |---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
   |   |Broad, ill defined, shared|limited, associated with a conflict, shared | personal, limits action | personal, hinders action |
   | Enemy Forces | A mob of mooks is advancing on the village. | A squad of mooks is guarding the treasure. | A gang of mooks has you cornered. | The jeers of the mooks have intimidated you. |
   | Sleep Spell | Local creatures have become lethargic due to a curse. | A magical barrier makes all who touch it fall unconscious. | You are unconscious. | The effects of the spell make you slow to react. | 
   | Constraints |   | a prison | tied up | handcuffed |
## Locations
* when you act on a goal or obstacle, or help someone else to do so, movemyour token from staged to present
* when the current goal's beats are exhausted, move all the present tokens to away.
* if there are no tokens staged, have a scene about the setting or theme, then move everyone's token to staged (unless they have a restraint) 
 * setting: bringdown, monologue?
 * theme : commentary, chorus
