# Dramatis Person√¶
Each player should bring a single unique focal character to the story.  These are the most fleshed out characters, with the most mechanical details, and are referred to as **protagonists**.

#### Name, Epithet, Adjectives
Players should select a name for the **protagonist**, as well as an epithet, which can be a descriptive byname, professional title, or archetype that provides a quick impression of what others might expect from the character.

It's also encouraged to list a handful of adjectives that describe the character.  In standard play, these aren't mechanically relevant, but are intended to simply provide a prompt of guide to roleplaying interactions with the character.  As such, they can be physcially descriptive (e.g. tall, dark, handsome) or summarize personality traits (e.g. kind, honest, gentle), or indicate other attributes (e.g. agile, strong, clever), or skills (e.g. stealthy, crack-shot, hacker).

*{compose option to formalize these?)*

*{maybe just start with a handful, and add to list during the roll setup?}*

#### Gimmick
Each **protagonist** has a single so-called **gimmick** that represents a special way that the character solves problems.  These should of course be distinct from other **protagonists'** **gimmicks**.  **Gimmicks** represent the go-to, core ability or signature move of a protagonist that sets them apart from other characters, described in a few words.  These aren't meant to exhaustively describe a character's abilities, but instead are the one most essential kind thing that the character does *in his current incarnation*.  A player should choose a gimmick based on what she wants to describe the character doing in the session.

| Character | Gimmick |
|:---:|:---:|
| Annie Oakley | Trick Shot |
| Sherlock Holmes | Deduction |
| Mata Hari | Seduction |
| Tarzan | Dominate |
| Dr Caligari | Mesmerize |
| A.J. Raffles | Burglary |
| Galahad | Purity |
| Achilles | Invulnerability |
| Houdini | Escape |
| Scarlet Pimpernel | Disguise |

*{refine the breadth of this element.  Try to provide examples with more variety, or re-write these to be more varied.}*

#### Statistics:
Each protagonist has a number of numberical statistics that are used throughout play.
* Artha

Prosperity, profit, etc.  To what degree the character can bring outside support and resources to bear to overcome challenges.
Artha is earned by overcoming **agones**, and spent to buy **assets**.  In standard play, each character begins with five (5) **artha**.  **Artha** is treated as currency during play.  As they are spent, they are essentially lost, invested in the **assets** purchased by them. As such, it's sometimes easier to use tokens during a session, and merely record a balance on a character record for between sessions.
* Complexity

The 'roundness' of the character.  To what degree the character has flaws and opprotunities for growth.  Complexity is earned by pushing the character's limits and attempting things that are difficult, and spent to turn failure into success by transforming and internalizing conflict.  In standard play, each character begins with a **complexity** of three (3).  **Complexity** almost always increases, so it can be tracked with tally marks.
* Mukti

Wisom, detachment, self-knowledge.  To what degree to which the character overcome adversity and persevere.  Mukti is earned by renouncing Artha and Complexity.  In standard play, characters don't begin with **mukti**.  Their **mukti** is zero (0). **Mukti** can also be tracked with tally marks, as it doesn't decrease.
* Destiny

Glory, import, or impact. To what degree the characters actions are potentially momentous. Destiny accumulates as a character successfully behaves as he is meant to.  In standard play, each character begins with a **destiny** of one (1).  Like **mukti**, **destiny** doesn't decrease and so can be tracked with tally marks.
* Rally

The amplitude of the ebb and flow of the story.  As a character suffers adversity, his rally increases, which allows him to make more rapid progress in overcoming future adversity. In standard play, each character begins with a **rally** of two (2).
**Rally**increases and decreases frequently through play, so it's represented using **rings**.

#### Rings
When a rule asks a player to add a **ring** to something, it means to to draw an empty circle on or near that something (as appropriate).  Additional **ring**s should be added in a row or neat bunch, because other rules will ask her to fill **ring**s, which means to indicate somehow that a **ring** is no longer empty, and other rules will ask for a count of how many **ring**s are filled or empty.

*{use illustrations to make this clear}*

#### Principal
In addition to the **protagonists**, the players might choose to include a **principal** as well.  A **principal** has all the same elements as a **protagonist**, but is not exclusive to any individual player.  As such, all the players should agree to including a **principal**, and should play an equal part in his creation.

*{formal rules to create a principal among multiple people?}*
*{maybe use destiny to determine some stats and the order in which players contribute}*

***
As a protagonist participates in stories, he will earn **experience** that can be spent to **grow** as a character.

* additional gimmicks
* additional beats
* advancement
    * additional complications (increased *complexity*)
    * upgraded resources (increased *artha*)
