# The Play
## Types of play
   * a party of heroes against shared challenges
   * a team supporting a principal
   * characters facing both shared and personal challenges, wherein players can be antagonistic
### Prologue
- characters are in a zone of comfort
- discover what they want
- introduce challenges and themes
- rank them

1. To prepare for play, establish the **table setup** and discuss what **options** the group would like to include.
1. If you'll be using a **principal character**, create or review her together at this time.
1. Each player should then either write up a new **player character** or review and revise an existing one.  Go around the table  giving a very breif description of said character, and making sure that you have **relationship** cards for each combination, and **bank destiny** as appropriate to the **player character**'s score.
1. Then, each player should take some time to create **goal**s for each her **player character**.  
  1. In standard play, each player will provide three (3) **goal**s.  These can be new, or left over from previous sessions.
  1. The goals should be ranked and **rating**s given to each in order to indicate how momentus a part the player would like them to play in the story.  In standard play, give the most momentous **goal** a **rating** equal to five (5) or the number of players plus one (whichever is higher), the least momentous a rating of one (1), and the remaining **goal** a rating of three (3).
  1. If you've chosen to designate a **lead narrator**, she may have prepared some or all of these ahead of time.
  1. Adjust the number and rating of the goals for shorter or longer play sessions.
1. Make a stack of everyone's **goal**s, front-side up. Shuffle the stack and place it in the center of the **on-screen** area.  This is the **plot stack** for Act I. 
  
### Act I
- enter an unfamiliar situation to get what they want
- go through each challenge quickly, converting some to resoures for use later

1. Play begins with the **goal** on top of the **plot stack**.  
1. Each **goal** is afforded only one **beat** in Act I.  If it is not **resolved** in that beat, add an empty ring to it's rating and move it to the top of a new **plot stack** in the **staged** area.
1. When the **plot stack** for Act I. is exhausted, move the new **plot stack** from the **staged** area to the **on-screen** area.  This is the **plot stack** for Act II.
  
### Act II
- adapt to the unfamiliar situation
- go through each challenge slowly, wearing them down to a few
1. Play continues with the **goal** on top of the **plot stack**.
1. In Act II, each **goal** is afforded a number of **beat**s equal to the number of players.
  1. If a **goal** is **resolved** before all of the **beats** assigned to it have been played, **bank destiny** equal to the number of **beat**s not used.
  1. If a **goal** is not **resolved** in the **beat**s allowed, add an empty ring to it's rating and move it to the bottom of the **plot stack**.
1. When the number of **goal**s remaining in the plot stack equal the number of players, lay these remaining **goal**s out individually in the **on-screen** area and proceed to Act III.
  
### Act III
- get what you want
- ...having paid a heavy price
- lay out the remaining challenges and address them freely
- campaign play vs session play
1. The last player to **take the lead** in Act II designates which other player may begin Act III.
1. The designated player may choose to pass or choose any of the remaining **goal**s to address.
  1. If they choose to address a **goal**, play one beat as normal in which they automatically **take the lead**.
  1. If a **goal** is **resolved**, discuss if the group would like to proceed to the Epilogue or continue play.
  1. If no more goals remain, proceed to the Epilogue.  
1. Otherwise, designate the next player counter-clockwise to **take the lead** and repeat teh previous step.

### Epilogue
- return to the familiar, having changed
- assess the results, explore how the characters have changed. (spend rewards)
    - advance a inclination
    - upgrade a resource
