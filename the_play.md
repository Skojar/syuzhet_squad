# The Play
## Types of play
   * a party of heroes against shared challenges
   * a team supporting a principal
   * characters facing both shared and personal challenges, wherein players can be antagonistic
### Prologue
In the prologue we meet our central characters in their comfort zone, then learn what challenges they will face.

1. To prepare for play, establish the **table setup** and discuss what **options** the group would like to include.
1. If you'll be using a **principal character**, create or review her together at this time.
1. Each player should then... 
   * either write up a new **player character** or review and revise an existing one, and give the rest of the players a breif description,
   * make sure that you have **relationship** cards for each combination of characters that warrants one,
   * review and describe any **asset**s that will have available and place them in the **staged** area,
   * and **bank destiny** as appropriate to the **player character**'s score.
1. Then, each player should take some time to create **goal**s for each her **player character**.  
   * In standard play, each player will provide three (3) **goal**s.  These can be new, or left over from previous sessions.
   * The goals should be ranked and **rating**s given to each in order to indicate how momentus a part the player would like them to play in the story.  In standard play, give the most momentous **goal** a **rating** equal to five (5) or the number of players plus one (whichever is higher), the least momentous a rating of one (1), and the remaining **goal** a rating of three (3).
   * If you've chosen to designate a **lead narrator**, she may have prepared some or all of these ahead of time.
   * Adjust the number and rating of the goals for shorter or longer play sessions.
1. Make a stack of everyone's **goal**s, front-side up. Shuffle the stack and place it in the center of the **on-screen** area.  This is the **plot stack** for Act I. 
  
### Act I
In Act I our main characters fully enter an unfamiliar situation.  Each of the major story arcs, and many of key resources that will come up later are introduced.

1. Play begins with the card on top of the **plot stack**.  
1. Each **goal** is afforded only one **beat** in Act I.  If it is not **resolved** in that beat, add an empty ring to it's rating and move it to the top of a new **plot stack** in the **staged** area.
1. When the **plot stack** for Act I is exhausted, move the new **plot stack** from the **staged** area to the **on-screen** area.  This is the **plot stack** for Act II.
  
### Act II
In Act II our main characters experience various highs and lows while trying to adapt to what has happened to them.  Complexities multiply, and they face seemingly insurmountable challenges.

1. Play continues with the **goal** on top of the **plot stack**.
1. In Act II, each **goal** is afforded a number of **beat**s equal to the number of players.
   * If a **goal** is **resolved** before all of the **beats** assigned to it have been played, **bank destiny** equal to the number of **beat**s not used.
   * If a **goal** is not **resolved** in the **beat**s allowed, add an empty ring to it's rating and move it to the bottom of the **plot stack**.
1. When the number of **goal**s remaining in the plot stack equal the number of players, lay these remaining **goal**s out individually in the **on-screen** area and proceed to Act III.
  
### Act III
In Act III our main characters accheive one or more major goals, but at a heavy price. 

1. The last player to **take the lead** in Act II designates which other player may begin Act III.
1. The designated player may choose to pass or choose any of the remaining **goal**s to address.
   * If she chooses to address a **goal**, play one beat as normal in which she must **take the lead**.
   * If a **goal** is **resolved**, discuss if the group would like to proceed to the Epilogue or continue play.
   * If no more goals remain to be **resolved**, proceed to the Epilogue.  
   * Otherwise, the next player to her left is designated to **take the lead** and this step repeats.

### Epilogue
In the Epilogue the characters return to the familiar, having changed.  

1. Any remaining **destiny** is apportioned equally (rounding up) to all the players as **experience**.
1. Each player in turn...
   * depicts her **player character** in a scene and indicating their **character growth**.
   * review and describe any **goal**s remaining from Act III that she owns.
