# The Things you'll need

### The Players
The most important equipment you'll need are a small group of enthusiastic, creative, and open-minded participants, ready to depict, describe, and portray various parts of the story, including most especially characters, settings, and action sequences.  This type of game is what is commonly referred to as a 'role playing' or 'story-telling' game, because the players play roles and collaboratively tell a story.

Certain innovations in these rules go a step further, into the realm of 'story-making.'  That is, the narrative is built mechanically from consituent parts during play, rather than being prepared ahead of time.  The rules create the narrative structure, and hopefully generate tension and drama.  The players provide the flavor, color, and exposition that make the drama *matter*.

Readers familiar with role playing games will be familiar with the concept of a so-called 'game-master' or GM, a player who takes on the responsibility of being a referee and driving play forward, often providing most or all of the details of the world in which a small collection of special characters---controlled by the other players---act out a story.  Generally the GM will be charged with resolving questions according to set rules and sometimes simply by fiat.

As an alternative, some games are what is know as GM-less, meaning either that no single player performs those duties, or that they are not necessary.  Usually this means that resolving questions and driving the story forward are formalized in the rules of the game.

This game will seem very much of the second sort, in that most of the duties assigned to a GM in traditional role playing games codified in the rules.  However, certain elements of play have an explicit **owner** who will be called upon to fulfill some of the functions that a GM would perfomr, most notably those involving improvisational narration and description.  All players are by default **owner**s, and so this game is perhaps more properly called GM-ful, in the sense that there aren't one nor none, but *many* game-masters.

This style of play might not suit every group, but it is relatively easy to adjust the rules such that there are fewer game-masters.  Those players who wish to abducate those responsibilities simply do so, and when they are called upon to act as an **owner** or a game element, a previously designated different player does so in her stead.  In the simplest case, a single player may be so designated by all the other players, re-creating the traditional structure and acting as **lead narrator**, or the duties may be shared among multiple players.  These rules assume first that all players are acting as **owners**, but call out points in play where having a **lead narrator** would change the dynamic.  Working out hybrid situations between those two extremes are left as an excercise for individual play groups.

### Dice
The core resolution mechanic in this game involves the use of ordinary six-sided dice. While it's possible to play with only one, and these rules are written assuming they're either all the same or of a wide variety, in practice play goes smoothest when about six dice in each of two different colors are made available.  One color should be designated from the start as **start** dice, and the other as **stop** dice.  In illustraions these will be depicted as white (**stop**) and black (**start**).

### Cards
Most of the mechanics involve small slips of paper referred to in the rules as 'cards.'  These rules were written assuming something like a unruled, three inch by five inch index card, but anything of similar size and durability should work.  Each player will need several.  Each player should also have a writing implement such as a pen or pencil ready at hand.

### Tokens, Markers, and Counters
Finally, players will be called upon to manipulate various physical tokens, markers and counters, in four varieties:

* **presence markers**: These should be distinctive and unique. Game pawns or miniatures are ideal. You will need one for each player. 
* **beat counters**: These should be easy to see, pickup and move, but stable. Jacks work well. Again, you will need as many as there are players, but these should all be the same.
* **destiny tokens**: Something like poker chips works well.  You will need maybe a couple dozen total. 
* **experience tokens**: Something small like stones or pennies.  You are likely to need about a half-score per player.  

With the exception of the **presence markers**, these should be set aside to be put into and removed from play as needed, perhaps in bowls or similar shallow containers.

### Table setup
The play area should be divided into three distinct areas.  Two in the center are referred to as the **on-screen** area and the **staged** area.  Around these, each player should have a space for her **player character** card and any **complication**s and **hurdle**s.  These spaces are collectively referred to as the **away** area.  

Throughout the course of play, unique **marker**s representing each **player character** will be moved between **on-screen**, **staged** and **away** as described in various rules.  This always means physically moving the **marker** or **marker**s in question.  A **player character** is said to be **on-screen**, **staged** or **away** based on the location of the **marker** representing him. 

Players are encouraged to adopt a philosophy of *mise en place* during play, as the location of various physical objects, as well as the readily availablilty of those objects, is at time important to the proper functioning of the rules.
