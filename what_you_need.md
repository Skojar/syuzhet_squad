### Dice
The core resolution mechanic in this game involves the use of ordinary six-sided dice. While it's possible to play with only one, and these rules are written assuming they're either all the same or of a wide variety, in practice play goes smoothest when about six dice in each of two different colors are made available.  One color should be designated from the start as **start** dice, and the other as **stop** dice.  In illustraions these will be depicted as white (**stop**) and black (**start**).

### Cards
Most of the other mechanics involve small slips of paper referred to in the rules as 'cards.'  These rules were written assuming something like a unruled three inch by five inch index card, but anything of similar size and durability should work.  Each player will need several.

### Tokens, Markers, and Counters
Finally, players will called to manipulate various physical tokens, markers and counters, in four varieties:

* **presence markers**: one for each player, distinctive and unique (game pawns or miniatures)
* **beat counters**: as many as there are players, easy to see, pickup and move (we use jacks)
* **destiny tokens**: maybe a couple dozen, something like poker chips works well.
* **experience tokens**: potentially a half-score per player.  Something small like stones or pennies.

With the exception of the **presence markers**, these should be set aside to be put into and removed from play as needed.

### Table setup
The play area, should be divided into three main areas.  Two in the center designated as the **on-screen** area and the **staged** area.  Around these, each player should have a space for her **player character** card and any **complication**s and **hurdle**s.  These spaces are collectively referred to as **away**.  

The **staged** area should have space for a 'bank' of **destiny tokens** and a stack of **asset** cards.

Throughout the course of play, unique **marker**s representing each **player character** will be moved between **on-screen**, **staged** and **away** as described in various rules.  This always means physically moving the **marker** or **marker**s in question.  A **player character** is said to be **on-screen**, **staged** or **away** based on the location of the **marker** representing him.
