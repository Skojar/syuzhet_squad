### playing out a story beat
1. That **goal**'s **owner** depicts a situation related to that **goal**.
1. The **owner** then designates any other player whose token is either **staged** or **on-screen** to **take the lead**.
1. The designated player may choose to accept, or decline and choose a different player (including the **goals**'s owner) to **take the lead** in her place.  This second player must accept.

### Strain a Resource
1. Roll a number of dice equal to the number of open rings on the resource.
1. For each one or six result, claim a bonus stone.
1. For each result of one, fill an open ring.
1. If there are no more open rings, *put the resource in crisis*.

### Resolving Questions with Rolls
The core means of determining how a beat or question is resolved is the roll.  The active character will roll a number of `start` and `stop` dice, with other players influencing the number of dice and the interpretation of the result, as follows:
1. Start by determining the number of `start` dice to roll.
    * Is the character doing something she is good at?  If so, add one `start` die.
    * Is the character doing something that is her `thing`?  If so, add one `start` die.
    * Add one `start` die for each character who prepared for this moment.  See `Flashback` below.
    * If you haven't added any dice, add one.  You should always roll at least one `start` die.
1. Roll your `start` dice.  Record the highest result.  If multiple sixes are showing, bank a number of `points` equal to how many extras there are.
1. Determine the number of `stop` dice to roll.
    * Is the character taking a risk?  i.e. will failure, fictionally, be bad for the character?  If so, add one `stop` die.
    * Is the character doing something that is, for whatever reason, difficult for her in particular?  If so, add one `stop` die.
    * Add one `stop` die for each relevant complication active on the character.
    * If you haven't added any dice, add one.  You should always roll at least one `stop` die.
1.  Roll your `stop` dice.  Add the lowest result shown to the result from your `start` dice roll.
    * The default target is eight (8). If there are any obstacles in the way, add one to that target for each.
    * Other players may choose to `lend a hand` at this time to decrease the target.
    * If your `start` result plus your `stop` result meet or exceed the target, the action is successful. Describe how the beat goes as you had hoped.
    * If by elimiating any number of `stop` dice would lead to a success, and the player has remaining `vulnerabilities`, the player may choose to **buy a success**.
        * take a complication with a rating equal to the number of dice being eliminated.
        * Describe how the beat goes as you had hoped despite the costs.
    * If it is not possible to buy a success, or the player chooses not to, then you fail:
    
        | If you're addressing... | ...then a failure means |
        |:---:|:---:|
        | goal | a new obstacle |
        | obstacle | a new hurdle |
        | hurdle | nothing  |
        | condition | nothing  |

        
1. Regardless of the outcome, the player marks experience equal to the number of `stop` dice less the number of `start` dice.


# Actions


### Take Center Stage
### Lead by Proxy
### Lend a Hand
### Make an Entrance
i.e. jump in to save the day, taking the complication from a bought success onto yourself?
Can you transfer a complication to yourself?
Can you convert someone else's hurdle to a challenge?
### Dialogue
i.e. two characters working on a complication or hurdle.
Must be in the same *location*, e.g. present, staged, or away
### Monologues
i.e. a character working on her own complications, without anyone else present.
### Chorus
i.e. two or more minor characters interacting with each other.  Can change conditions for main characters, like make a timeskip of location change, or change context.
### Flashback
If you have a boon or resource you'd like to spend to help or hinder the character at center stage, describe how it impacts the current beat.  If it's a boon, turn it over and add it to the bottom of the plot. If it's a resource, `strain it`.  In either case, either a single `start` or `stop` die to the roll.

You can retroactively create a resource or advantage by spending a `banked point`.  Describe how you prepared for this moment and roll
### Exit Stage Left
i.e. mark yourself an unoccupied after already acting in a scene.
### Delay the Inevitable
i.e. skip the remaining beats on a challenge by moving it to the bottom of the plot.
### Antagonize 
i.e. create a personal challenge for another player's primary character

partial successes essentially move obstacle points to character.  What would the reverse equivalent be?  
~This is needed to allow for adversarial relationships~
WRONG! adding to another character's conditions is a subset of `dialogue`!

# Adversity
Goals, Obstacles, Complications and Hurdles
challenges, Restraints, Threats, etc.
## Elements of a Challenge
* Owner
* Rating
* Question Prompt
    "How did we get here?"
    "What does this mean to you?"
    "Why does it matter?"
    * stakes: what is there to win or lose?
    
## Types of Goals
These are prompts from which the core story will be developed.  They are the roots of the tree.

    * Dilemma:  a character needs to decide between two paths
    * Desire: a character wants something that may be difficult to acquire
    * Destination: a character wants to get somewhere
    * Discovery: a character must come to terms with new information
    * Mystery: a character seeks the answer to a question
    * Exigency: events demand action from the character
    * Confrontation: someone (a rival) or something (a crisis) challenges the character's status quo
    
    
## Obstacles
## Types of Complications
angry, upset, shaken, depressed, disarmed, disconnected, confused, vulnerable, obsessed, injured, distracted, embarassed, conflicted, weakened, harrowed, distress ed, hobbled
## Types of Hurdles
trapped, crippled, unconscious, despondent, restrained, seperated

   | Enemy Forces | A mob of mooks is advancing on the village. | A squad of mooks is guarding the treasure. | A gang of mooks has you cornered. | The jeers of the mooks have intimidated you. |
   | Sleep Spell | Local creatures have become lethargic due to a curse. | A magical barrier makes all who touch it fall unconscious. | You are unconscious. | The effects of the spell make you slow to react. | 
   | Constraints |   | a prison | tied up | handcuffed |
## Locations
* when you act on a goal or obstacle, or help someone else to do so, movemyour token from staged to present
* when the current goal's beats are exhausted, move all the present tokens to away.
* if there are no tokens staged, have a scene about the setting or theme, then move everyone's token to staged (unless they have a restraint) 
 * setting: bringdown, monologue?
 * theme : commentary, chorus
