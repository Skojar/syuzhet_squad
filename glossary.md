### Strain a Resource
1. Roll a number of dice equal to the number of open rings on the resource.
1. For each one or six result, claim a bonus stone.
1. For each result of one, fill an open ring.
1. If there are no more open rings, *put the resource in crisis*.

### Resolving Questions with Rolls
The core means of determining how a beat or question is resolved is the roll.  The active character will roll a number of `start` and `stop` dice, with other players influencing the number of dice and the interpretation of the result, as follows:
1. Start by determining the number of `start` dice to roll.
    * Is the character doing something she is good at?  If so, add one `start` die.
    * Is the character doing something that is her `thing`?  If so, add one `start` die.
    * Add one `start` die for each character who prepared for this moment.  See `Flashback` below.
    * If you haven't added any dice, add one.  You should always roll at least one `start` die.
1. Roll your `start` dice.  Record the highest result.  If multiple sixes are showing, bank a number of `points` equal to how many extras there are.
1. Determine the number of `stop` dice to roll.
    * Is the character taking a risk?  i.e. will failure, fictionally, be bad for the character?  If so, add one `stop` die.
    * Is the character doing something that is, for whatever reason, difficult for her in particular?  If so, add one `stop` die.
    * Add one `stop` die for each relevant complication active on the character.
    * If you haven't added any dice, add one.  You should always roll at least one `stop` die.
1.  Roll your `stop` dice.  Add the lowest result shown to the result from your `start` dice roll.
    * The default target is eight (8). If there are any obstacles in the way, add one to that target for each.
    * Other players may choose to `lend a hand` at this time to decrease the target.
    * If your `start` result plus your `stop` result meet or exceed the target, the action is successful. Describe how the beat goes as you had hoped.
    * If by elimiating any number of `stop` dice would lead to a success, and the player has remaining `vulnerabilities`, the player may choose to **buy a success**.
        * take a complication with a rating equal to the number of dice being eliminated.
        * Describe how the beat goes as you had hoped despite the costs.
    * If it is not possible to buy a success, or the player chooses not to, then you fail:
    
        | If you're addressing... | ...then a failure means |
        |:---:|:---:|
        | goal | a new obstacle |
        | obstacle | a new hurdle |
        | hurdle | nothing  |
        | condition | nothing  |

        
1. Regardless of the outcome, the player marks experience equal to the number of `stop` dice less the number of `start` dice.
