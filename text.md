GM?
### Dice
### Cards
### Tokens, Markers, Counters and Pawns
* **presence markers:** a unique one for each player, distinctive and large (game pawns or miniatures)
* **beat coutners:** as many as there are players, easy to see, pickup and move (we use jacks)
* **point:** maybe a couple dozen, small stones or poker chips
* do these cover gear, intel?

# Resources & Advantages (Assets?)
people places things ideas
the face describes them and indicated their durability.
the reverse indicates the kind of problem that 
if they have no durability, they're advantages.

Relationships between main characters and between them and the principal are a special kind of resource.
    What matters is the stability and reliability of the relationship.  Enemies can have a solid relationship, and when it's "troubled" they need to resolve the uncertainty in the same way that friends who've had a falling out. 

# Actions
### Resolving Questions with Rolls
The core means of determining how a beat or question is resolved is the roll.  The active character will roll a number of `start` and `stop` dice, with other players influencing the number of dice and the interpretation of the result, as follows:
1. Start by determining the number of `start` dice to roll.
    1. Is the character doing something she is good at?  If so, add one `start` die.
    1. Is the character doing something that is her `thing`?  If so, add one `start` die.
    1. Add one `start` die for each character who prepared for this moment.  See `Flashback` below.
    1. If you haven't added any dice, add one.  You should always roll at least one `start` die.
1. Roll your `start` dice.  Record the highest result.  If multiple sixes are showing, bank a number of `points` equal to how many extras there are.
1. Determine the number of `stop` dice to roll.
    1. Is the character taking a risk?  i.e. will failure, fictionally, be bad for the character?  If so, add one `stop` die.
    1. Is the character doing something that is, for whatever reason, difficult for her in particular?  If so, add one `stop` die.
    1. Add one `stop` die for each relevant complication active on the character.
    1. If you haven't added any dice, add one.  You should always roll at least one `stop` die.
1.  Roll your `stop` dice.  Add the lowest result shown to the result from your `start` dice roll.
    1. The default target is eight (8). If there are any obstacles in the way, add one to that target for each.
    1. Other players may choose to `lend a hand` at this time to decrease the target.
    1. If your `start` result plus your `stop` result meet or exceed the target, the action is successful. Describe how the beat goes as you had hoped.
    1. If by elimiating any number of `stop` dice would lead to a success, and the player has remaining `vulnerabilities`, the player may choose to **buy a success**.
        * Introduce a complication with a rating equal to the number of dice being eliminated.
        * Describe how the beat goes as you had hoped despite the costs.
    1. If it is not possible to buy a success, or the player chooses not to, then add an obstacle to the challenge.
1. Regardless of the outcome, the player marks experience equal to the number of `stop` dice less the number of `start` dice.

### Take Center Stage
### Lead by Proxy
### Lend a Hand
### Make an Entrance
i.e. jump in to save the day, taking the complication from a bought success onto yourself?
### Dialogue
i.e. two characters working on a complication.
### Monologues
i.e. a character working on her own complications, without anyone else present.
### Chorus
i.e. two or more minor characters interacting with each other.  Can change conditions for main characters, like make a timeskip of location change, or change context.
### Flashback
If you have a boon or resource you'd like to spend to help or hinder the character at center stage, describe how it impacts the current beat.  If it's a boon, turn it over and add it to the bottom of the plot. If it's a resource, `strain it`.  In either case, either a single `start` or `stop` die to the roll.

You can retroactively create a resource or advantage by spending a `banked point`.  Describe how you prepared for this moment and roll
### Exit Stage Left
i.e. mark yourself an unoccupied after already acting in a scene.
### Delay the Inevitable
i.e. skip the remaining beats on a challenge by moving it to the bottom of the plot.

partial successes essentially move obstacle points to character.  What would the reverse equivalent be?  
~This is needed to allow for adversarial relationships~
WRONG! adding to another character's conditions is a subset of `dialogue`!


# The Play

 introduce challenges and themes
 rank them
